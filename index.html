    <h1>Animations For Test Scores</h1>
      
      <p>
        Using some new features in our d3 core algorithm Dr. Bradshaw was able to create animations with data appended will also 
        maintaining a pleasent visual display. The first issue was to just write code that would transition between the given graphs.
        This was most likely done with .transition(). With the animations it is clear that the transitions are being slowly brought 
        into shape to give maximal appeal. This function can be done with the .ease() code. A small extra feature to show a more clear
        graph Bradshaw most likely added on a hover inside of te d3 code. The code .on(mouseover) and .on(mouseout) code can be used
        add details and these details can be refined isnide of our CSS such that the graphs are smooth with apealing colors during 
        and after the animations. There are other new commands that could have been present but these listed above are cleaely prevelant
        and within our material.
